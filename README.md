The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris. The set contains the length and width measurements for sepals and petals of the Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor. The columns of the data set correspond to sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The data set was created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher.

Pandas: A data analysis and manipulation tool built using the Python programming language.
Matplotlib.pyplot: Matplotlib is a library for data visualisation. Pyplot is an interface which provides a MATPLOT-like way of plotting. (matplotlib.pyplot, n.d.)
Numpy: brings the computational power of languages like C to Python, which is easier to use.  (Numpy, n.d.)
Random: Implements pseudo-random number generators.

Pairplot:

 
We can see from this pair plot that generally, the setosa variety is linearly separable from the other two. 
Scatter plots: 
In all of these scatter plots, we can see that the setosa variety is linearly separable to the other two. 
 
This plot shows that the setosa variant has sepals that are wide but not vet long. The other two variants have a roughly similar sepal width to length ratio. While the virginica and versicolor variants are comparable, it seems that the sepals of the virginica variant are slightly longer.


 
From this plot, we can see that the sepal and petals of the setosa variety are similar in length as there is not much spread within the group. We can also see that the sepals and petals of the setosa variety are shorter in comparison to the other two variants. The virginica variety has some of the longest sepals and petals as the data points extend almost to the top right of the plot. The versicolor variety have average petal and sepal lengths. 
 
We can see that the setosa variety has the lowest petal width- sepal length ratio of the 3. The setosa variety also has very little variation in petal widths and sepal lengths. The virgincia variety has some of the longest petal widths and sepal lengths. There is a lot of variation in the virgincia data as the points are very spread out.  The versicolor variety is somewhere in between. 

 
The setosa variety has some of highest sepal widths compared to petal lengths. The sepal width of this variety is much greater than the petal length. The other two varieties have similar ratios, again with the virginicas tending to be longer than the versicolors.
 


 
The setosa variety have the shortest and thinnest petals. Virginica and versicolor are similar to each other but again, the virginica variety has the longest and widest petals. The versicolor variety have average petal width and length.
